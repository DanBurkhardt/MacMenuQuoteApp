# MacMenuQuoteApp
A test application for learning macOS native app development.

## Sample notes
I created this application to begin learning native development for macOS in Swift. 

It's based on the tutorial for native macOS menu app development by Watten Burton via Ray Wenderlich: https://www.raywenderlich.com/450-menus-and-popovers-in-menu-bar-apps-for-macos

I did have to correct some items in the tutorial, namely storbaord instantiation, as the syntax was outdated in Swift 4. I also chose my own UI and built custom logic for wrapping around the quote array.

Cheers!
